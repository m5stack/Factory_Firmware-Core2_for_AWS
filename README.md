> <b>Effective March 6, 2023, AWS will end support for AWS IoT Kit, a program that guided builders on how to develop simple IoT applications with AWS Partner reference hardware and tutorials. AWS IoT Kitâ€™s reference hardware kit is made and sold by our manufacturing partner, M5Stack Technology Co., Ltd. (https://m5stack.com/), who will continue to offer and support the kit and related software for interested customers.</b>

# M5Stack Core2 for AWS IoT Kit Factory Firmware

Factory firmware for the M5Stack Core2 for AWS IoT Kit. Use this repository to restore your device to the original program or to investigate and freely modify.This application was written to be easy to understand and replicate instead of efficiency. View the API reference for using the included board support package.

## Cloning
This repo uses [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to bring in dependent components.

Note: If you download the ZIP file provided by GitHub UI, you will not get the contents of the submodules. Since the downloaded zip will also not be a git repository, you will not be able to compile the code since that is a toolchain requirement. You must clone the repository using the instructions below.

If using Windows, because this repository and its submodules contain symbolic links, set `core.symlinks` to true with the following command:
```
git config --global core.symlinks true
```
In addition to this, either enable [Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) or, whenever using a git command that writes to the system (e.g. `git pull`, `git clone`, and `git submodule update --init --recursive`), use a console elevated as administrator so that git can properly create symbolic links for this repository. Otherwise, symbolic links will be written as normal files with the symbolic links' paths in them as text. [This](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/) gives more explanation.

To clone using HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/m5stack/Factory_Firmware-Core2_for_AWS.git --recurse-submodules
```
Using SSH:
```
git clone git@github.com:m5stack/Factory_Firmware-Core2_for_AWS.git --recurse-submodules
```

If you have downloaded the repo without using the `--recurse-submodules` argument, you need to run:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Important files/folders

### main/main.c

This is the entry point for your application. Start by investigating and/or modifying this file for your needs.

### components/Core2-for-AWS-IoT-Kit

This is the location of the [board support package](https://github.com/m5stack/Core2-for-AWS-IoT-Kit). These include drivers and helper libraries for controlling the on-board peripherals on the device.

### components/esp-cryptoauthlib

This is a [ported cryptoauthlib](https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib) from Espressif. This fork is a specific port for the Core2 for AWS reference hardware. This library enables use of the on-board secure element and is tightly integrated with the ESP-IDF. The name of the folder should not be modified.

### partitions_16mb.csv

This is the partition table recommended for most applications. It provides sufficient file system sizes for storing Wi-Fi credentials, the user application, OTA updates, additional file storage, and storage for SPIFFS in the on-board flash. This utilizes the internal + external flash memory.
